- Calculate Mean and Variance: For each mini-batch, compute the mean and variance of the activations.

- Normalize: Subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation to normalize the activations.

- Scale and Shift: Apply learnable scale (𝛾) and shift (𝛽) parameters to the normalized activations

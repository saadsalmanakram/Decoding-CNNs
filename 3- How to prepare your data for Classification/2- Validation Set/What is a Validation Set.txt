Think of this as practice quizzes you take while studying. The model doesn't learn directly from these images, but we use them to check how well the model is doing. If the model keeps getting better scores on these quizzes, it means it's learning well. We also use this set to make sure the model isn't just memorizing the textbook (training set) but is actually learning the concepts so it can apply them to new images it has never seen before. This helps us avoid something called overfitting, where the model is great with the training images but bad with anything new.

- Year: 2012

- Developed by: Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton.

- Description: AlexNet popularized deep learning in computer vision by winning the ImageNet competition in 2012. It consists of eight layers: five convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers. It introduced ReLU activation and used dropout for regularization.

- Key Features: Large number of filters, overlapping max-pooling, data augmentation, and the use of GPUs for training.

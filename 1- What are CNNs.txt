Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) stand at the forefront of deep learning technologies, particularly excelling in visual computing tasks. They mimic the hierarchical pattern recognition system of the animal visual cortex, making them exceptionally proficient in managing and interpreting image data. This capability has catapulted CNNs into the limelight for applications including, but not limited to, image and video recognition, classification tasks, and medical image analysis.
